# Gyroscope Working

Simulator shows how the gyroscopic precession works. This simulator is my understanding of the gyroscope. Neither the input measurments nor the resultants are valid and may be used for only educational purposes.

### Controls

The viewport can be controllled using arrow keys for basic panning and '+' and '-' keys for zooming in and out. Mouse drag and scroll can be also used for the same. To pause/play use 'p' key and to add constant angular acceleration press spacebar.

### Live
Check out the live simulation on [Github.io](https://pronuba66.github.io/Gyroscope/).
